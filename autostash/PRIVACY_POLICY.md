# Privacy Policy for Autostash

**Effective Date: July 23, 2025**

We take your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy explains how the "Autostash" browser extension handles data.

### 1. No Collection of Personal Data

The core philosophy of this extension is privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data. There are no servers associated with this extension and no analytics tools.

### 2. Data Storage

The extension only stores the rules (URL patterns, keys, and values) that you create.

*   **Storage Location:** This data is stored locally on your device using the standard and secure `chrome.storage.sync` API.
*   **Purpose:** The storage is solely for the core functionality of the extension, ensuring your rules persist when you restart your browser.
*   **Access:** This data is **never** transmitted to us, the developers, or to any third party. Only you can access your rules. Synchronization across your devices is handled exclusively by Google's infrastructure if you are signed into your Chrome browser and is not visible to us.

### 3. Permissions Requested

The extension only requests permissions that are absolutely necessary for it to function and does not use them for tracking or data collection.

### 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy as needed. Changes will be published in the extension's GitHub repository.

### 5. Contact Us

If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can create an "Issue" in the project's GitHub repository.
